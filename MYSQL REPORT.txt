MySQL REPORT
MySQL is a relational database management system. Managed and owned by the Oracle corporation, it is an open source system used to store data and it works on many platforms. MySQL uses a client-server model, which means the database runs on the server. Computers that install and run RDBMS software are called clients, while the database lives on the server where clients access the data. MySQL uses the structure query language, known as SQL, to define, update, and query the database. Written in C and C++, MySQL is flexible, easy to use, secure, and balances high power with high performance.
