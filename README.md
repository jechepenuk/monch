# Social Media App

Our app is designed to be a destination for those those looking toc connect with other another over food, friends, and food related events. Each new user creates their profile with a unique username and is able to find other users to from the landing page of the app. 

## Landing Page

The landing page acts as an exploratory page which shows users content based on their interests. If the user is new, the page will show generic content aimed at the general public. If the user has begun to follow other users, the content of those they are following will show up closer to the top of the page. The user will be able to like and comment the multimedia posts on the landing page. These posts will include the types: image, gif, or video and will have the option for a caption.
Users will be able the click the user name linked to a post which directs them to that user's profile.

## Accounts

Each user will have an account, where they can edit their personal information, change their profile photo, or add content. When a user visits a profile other that than their own, they are able to follow that user, as well as see content explicitly posted by that user. Upon following that user, they are then able to send them direct messages.

## Messages

Upon opening messages from a user's profile, the user will be able to message the other and the chat will be saved. If "messages" is visited from the navigation bar, a different page will open showing all recent chats, with a start chat button and the ability to choose from those the user is following to chat with.
