# Social Media App

Our app is designed to be a destination for those those looking to connect with others over food, friends, and food related events. Each new user creates their profile with a unique username and is able to find other users to folloe from the landing page of the app. 

## Landing Page

The landing page allows new users to follow the creators of the site and search for their friends by username. If the user has begun to follow other users, the content of those they are following will show up on the landing page in reverse chronological order. The user will be able to like and comment the multimedia posts on the landing page. Users will be able the click the user name linked to a post which directs them to that user's profile. New messages received will notify the user in the navbar.

## Accounts

Each user will have an account, where they can edit or upload a profile picture, view their own posts, and edit a bio to tell other users about themselves. They will also be able to add content from their profile.

## Messages

Upon opening messages from a user's profile, the user will be able to message the other and the chat will be saved. If "messages" is visited from the navigation bar, a different page will open showing all recent chats. A search bar is available for the user to start a chat with a new friend.
