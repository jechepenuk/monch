# monch

Our app is designed to be a destination for those those looking to connect with others over food, friends, and food related events. Each new user resisters with their persoanl info and is redirected to the monch feed. Returning users login with their credentials to return to their feed.

## monch feed

The monch feed shows content in reverse chronological order and contains content from themselves and those they follow. If the user is not following anyone, three profiles are displayed as options to follow to get the user started with monch. The new user can also utilize the search bar to search for a friend. Posts are updated in real time if another user comments, likes, or creates new content on the feed. At the top of the feed, there is an option to make a new post which will redirect to the upload page.

## monch upload

The monch upload page allows users to upload content and optionally add a caption. The user is able to preview how their photo will appear on the feed page before the upload is completed. On upload, the user is redirected to their monch feed.

## monch profile

Each user will have an account which shows content specific to themselves. Posts show changes in likes and comments in real time on the monch profile. Users can add a post from their profile, which takes them to the monch uplaoad page. The user can also edit or upload a profile picture. The upload page for the profile picture works similarly to the upload post page, where the user can preview how their profile picture will look before they confirm upload.

## monch messages

Each page has a messages link in the navbar at the top of the page. Clicking messages will redirect you to monch messages. This page shows all current conversations with other users. If a user's name is flashing hot pink, it means that you have a new mesage from this user. When a name is clicked, you are redirected to a monch chat with that person.

## monch friends

If a user searches for another existing user or clicks a user's name with a link, they are redirected to monch friend, the friend's profile. If you are follow that user, you will see two buttons: unfollow and message. If you are not following them, you will see one button: follow. Either way, you are able to see their profile and all their content as all profiles on monch are public. If you decide to follow the user, the user's posts will show in your feed when you return to it. You are only allowed to message a user if you follow them, and when message is clicked, you are redirected to a moch chat page, which is private between you and the other user.

## monch chat

The monch chat is a private chat between two users. Messages show in real time and are stored and persistent through server restarts. If one user does not have the chat open, they will receive a hot pink flashing "new!" on their feed in the navbar indicating they have a new message. When "new!" is clicked, the user is redirected to the chat they have a new message from.
